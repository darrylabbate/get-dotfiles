## About

This repository is a mirror for the subdomain of my personal site. It contains a single shell script which can be invoked with `curl` to clone and install my [dotfiles](https://github.com/rootbeersoup/dotfiles). This provides the absolute easiest installation method should I have the misfortune of having to set up a new macOS device.

## How it Works

The script itself is fairly concise; It simply:

* Installs git
* Clones the [dotfiles](https://github.com/rootbeersoup/dotfiles) repository
* Invokes the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/rootbeersoup/dotfiles/blob/master/Makefile)
