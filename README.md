This repository is a mirror for the subdomain of my personal site. It contains a single shell script which can be invoked with `curl` to clone and install my dotfiles. This provides the absolute easiest installation method should I have the misfortune of having to set up a new macOS device.

I'll add more documentation here as well as commentary in the script itself in the near future.
